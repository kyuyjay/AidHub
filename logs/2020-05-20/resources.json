Project Chulia Street hopes Singaporeans will also show solidarity for our migrant workers by helping us to raise enough money to distribute Coronavirus Prevention Care Packets (CPCP) to 38,000 migrant workers.\r\n\r\nOur 2020 plan is to provide them to every migrant worker staying in our partnered migrant worker dormitories. The tentative calendar is attached in this post. However, we may need to speed up our timeline as the needs of the migrant workers are more pressing now.\r\n\r\nTo ensure every cent given is accounted for, we have detailed the cost breakdown of the CPCPs.\r\n\r\nThe items in each packet include:\r\n- Shampoo (S$1.95 per bottle)\r\n- Soap (S$1.00 per bottle)\r\n- Toothbrush (S$0.10 per bush)\r\n- Toothpaste (S$3.00 per tube)\r\n- Hand Sanitisers (S$1.50 per bottle)\r\n- Mask (S$7.90 for a packet of 10, S$0.79 per mask)\r\n- Top up prepaid phone card worth S$2.00 sponsored by Singtel that comes with insurance\r\n\r\nBased on estimates, each CPCP will cost about $8.34.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we aim to raise S$316,920 for the year. Here's how you can help.\r\n\r\n- Donate S$10 to give one migrant worker a care packet\r\n- Donate S$50 to help 5 migrant workers\r\n- Donate S$100 to benefit 10 migrant workers\r\n- Donate S$250 to keep 25 migrant workers safer\r\n- Donate S$500 to bless 50 migrant workers with care packets.","link":"https://www.facebook.com/projectchuliastreet/","date":null,"type":{"donFunds":"True"}}

To this end, we have built Sama Labour Exchange (SLX), a platform for companies to transfer foreign workers across sectors to manage manpower needs during Covid-19.\r\n\r\nWhy are we doing this?\r\n\r\nRecently, an event company approached us because they have many workers but no projects in the next few months. Their choices: send the workers back (with no guarantee that they will be allowed back in), ask the workers to take no pay leave, or keep paying out of pocket, hoping the situation gets better. None of these options are beneficial. At the same time,  we have another client in the food packaging industry who requires many workers in this testing period. We seek to match needs, to create win-wins.\r\n\r\nWe are charging a nominal fee for these transactions, which barely covers costs. Our mission is to leverage our skillsets to help place workers, relief companies of manpower costs, and transfer workers to companies which need labor.\r\n\r\nAs for cross contamination concerns, we will not use any workers under quarantine, SHN or linked to any clusters. The workers will essentially be like any workers currently working in the essential services.\r\n\r\nHow can we help?\r\n\r\nIf you own a business looking to transfer workers to other companies, options:\r\n1. \u0009Workers self sign-up at link: sama.sg or send “hi” to +65 3129 2222 on WhatsApp. We will then ask them for their Work Pass which then populates their data from MoM.\r\n2. \u0009Complete the form at bit.ly/ihaveworkers (as company)\r\n If you are looking to hire workers from other companies, options:\r\n1. \u0009Enter your request at http://bit.ly/ineedworkers\r\n2. \u0009We will immediately start looking for people you need and send you candidates that fit your requests.\r\nLet me know if you need more information and I will be happy to take you through the process.\r\nAlso, it will be great if you can help forward this information to peers whom you think might find this useful.\r\nThank you for your time and take care.\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew Ang Siong Yong (Hong Xiangyong)\r\nR2092096\r\n","link":null,"date":"10 Apr","type":{"info":"True"}}

Families already struggling to make ends meet are losing jobs and income, while essential service providers live in fear of bringing the virus into overcrowded homes. Their situations will deteriorate as long as the crisis continues.\r\n\r\nTo help provide immediate relief, you can donate to Mind the Gap. Your donation will go to a common pot of funds to support the households served by the following organisations: A Good Space, AWARE, Beyond Social Services, Cassia Resettlement Team, Daughters Of Tomorrow, ReadAble, and 6th Sense.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, here are other ways you can help:\r\n- If you wish to donate in kind (food \u0026amp; necessities only; no toys, clothes or books), you may email: mail@beyond.org.sg\r\n- If you have job opportunities, please provide the details in this form: bit.ly/2VGC5Zh\r\n\r\nMore importantly, existing mindsets and policies need to shift. For some, the current financial aid schemes are inadequate, difficult to access, or do not meet urgent needs. Inequalities exist throughout the system. If you do your part to support members within your communities that need help, as well as advocate for greater equality in the long run, then together, we can close the gap.\r\n","link":"https://give.asia/campaign/mind-the-gap-9584#/","date":"19 Apr","type":{"donFunds":"True"}}
